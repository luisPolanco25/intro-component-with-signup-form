# Frontend Mentor - Intro component with sign up form

This is my solution for this challenge made by Frontend Mentor. This was meant to be made for the widths of 1440px and 375px, but I tried to take it further even if it wasn't close to how the design looks like. I used some packages through the development of this to make it simpler. These are <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator">validator.js</a> and <a href="https://sweetalert2.github.io/#examples">Sweetalert2</a>. I also use one of the custom hooks I have created in my repositories, <a href="https://github.com/luisPolanco25/Custom-Hooks">useForm</a>.
